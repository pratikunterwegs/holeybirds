## Workflow

### Analysis Source Code

The source code for the analyses reported here can be found in the directory `scripts/`, and are explained briefly here:

- `scripts/01_xx.Rmd`: Process the output, in the form of _Rds_ objects, that result from running _Pathomove_ replicates or parameter combinations.

- `scripts/02_xx.Rmd`: Process the pairwise individual associations logged during the simulation into social networks.

- `scripts/03_xx.Rmd`: Run SIR models on the emergent social networks acquired from simulation runs.

**Add more scripts here**

---

## Figure Source Code

The source code for the figures in this manuscript is in the directory `figure_scripts/`. These scripts are well commented, and are not explained further.

### Figures

## Manuscript Text

The main text of the manuscript is written in LaTeX and is stored in the (private) submodule, `manuscript`.
Using the shell scripts provided in `bash/`, the LaTeX files are converted into date-stamped PDFs.
These are not uploaded here, but the `docs/` folder indicates their storage location.

## Supplementary Material

The supplementary material provided with this manuscript is generated from the `supplement/` directory.

**List supplementary files**

- Other files in this directory are helper files required to format the supplementary material.

## Other Directories

- `bash/` Some useful shell scripts for output rendering.
