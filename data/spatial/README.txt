This folder contains various spatial datasets used in our study.
The key layers here are the extent vector of the Hula Valley, which is used to subset raster data, and the land cover classification polygons, which are used in the study.
The extent vector is drawn ad-hoc, as spatial data are clipped to the extent of the available raster layers (the limiting layer is the DSM/CHM), yet it is made available here for use.
The land cover shapefile is available from our associated data archive on Zenodo, please see the main README for a link to this archive.
